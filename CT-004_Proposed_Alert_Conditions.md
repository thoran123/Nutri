# CT-004 Proposed Alert Conditions (Week 5 Final)

## Baseline Tuning Notes
These thresholds are tuned for typical small to medium Nutri-Help authentication traffic and should be re-validated weekly using rolling 7-day median and peak values.

- Baseline assumptions:
  - Login traffic: 5 to 30 attempts per minute during peak windows.
  - Failed login rate under normal conditions: below 3%.
  - MFA failure rate under normal conditions: below 5%.
  - 429 rate-limit responses should remain near zero for legitimate users.
- Tuning method:
  - Keep configured trigger threshold >= 3x normal baseline for volume rules.
  - Increase threshold only after two consecutive weeks of false positives.
  - Decrease threshold immediately if confirmed malicious activity bypasses detection.
- Alert deduplication:
  - Dedup window: 5 minutes per unique alert fingerprint (Alert ID + principal + IP).
- AI endpoint tagging:
  - For AI-related alerts, include `ai_endpoint_tag` and `ai_operation_type` in payload.
  - Current AI endpoint tags:
    - `/api/chatbot/*` -> `AI_CHAT`
    - `/api/plan/generate` -> `AI_PLAN_GENERATION`
    - `/api/image/*` -> `AI_IMAGE`
